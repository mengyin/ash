\title{estimate mixture proportions of sigmaa by EM algorithm}
\usage{
EMest(betahat, sebetahat, g, prior, null.comp = 1, nullcheck = TRUE,
  VB = FALSE, cxx = FALSE, df = NULL, control = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{betahat}{(n vector of observations)}

\item{sebetahat}{(n vector of standard errors/deviations of observations)}

\item{g}{the prior distribution for beta (usually estimated from the data; this is used primarily in simulated data to do computations with the "true" g)}

\item{prior}{string, or numeric vector indicating Dirichlet prior on mixture proportions (defaults to "uniform", or (1,1...,1); also can be "nullbiased" (nullweight,1,...,1) to put more weight on first component)}

\item{null.comp}{the position of the null component}

\item{nullcheck}{whether to check that any fitted model exceeds the "null" likelihood
in which all weight is on the first component}

\item{VB}{whether to use Variational Bayes to estimate mixture proportions (instead of EM to find MAP estimate), see \code{\link{mixVBEM}} and \code{\link{mixEM}}}

\item{cxx}{flag to indicate whether to use the c++ (Rcpp) version. After application of Squared extrapolation methods for accelerating fixed-point iterations (R Package "SQUAREM"), the c++ version is no longer faster than non-c++ version, thus we do not recommend using this one, and might be removed at any point.}

\item{df}{appropriate degrees of freedom for (t) distribution of betahat/sebetahat, default is NULL(Gaussian)}

\item{control}{A list of control parameters for the SQUAREM algorithm, default value is set to be   control.default=list(K = 1, method=3, square=TRUE, step.min0=1, step.max0=1, mstep=4, kr=1, objfn.inc=1,tol=1.e-07, maxiter=5000, trace=FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list, including the final loglikelihood, the null loglikelihood, a n by k likelihoodmatrix with (j,k)th element equal to \eqn{f_k(x_j)},and a flag to indicate convergence.
